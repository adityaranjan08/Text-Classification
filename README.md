## Text Classification - Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Text_Classification.ipynb`) that explores text classification techniques. 

**What's in the notebook?**

The notebook likely covers the following steps involved in text classification:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - This section might involve loading a text dataset and performing necessary cleaning steps like removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and potentially stemming or lemmatization.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - The notebook might explore techniques to convert textual data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms. This could involve methods like TF-IDF or bag-of-words representation.

3. **Model Building and Training:**
    - This section might involve training a machine learning model for text classification. Common algorithms used for text classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks.

4. **Evaluation:**
    - The notebook might showcase how to evaluate the performance of the trained model on a test dataset. This could involve metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

**Getting Started**

To run this notebook, you'll need:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Required libraries (likely mentioned at the beginning of the notebook) - You might need to install these using `pip install <library_name>`
